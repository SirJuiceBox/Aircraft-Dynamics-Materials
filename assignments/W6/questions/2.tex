\begin{question}
\begin{enumerate} \-\
    \item Estimate the required bank angle, $\phi$, \emph{in degrees} that are needed for a Boeing 747 to maintain a steady level coordinated turn that completes a full circle every three minutes at sea level and a speed of 221 ft/s (Case I in Appendix E).

    \item Find the wind angles, $\Delta \alpha$ and $\beta$, and control inputs $\delta_a$, $\delta_r$, and $\Delta \delta_e$, \emph{all in degrees} needed to maintain this turn. The nondimensional derivatives can be found in Table 6.1, 6.6, and 7.3, and physical parameters can be found in Appendix E of the textbook. The following lines of code can be copied and pasted to save some typing if you can figure out how to use them:

\begin{verbatim}
[-0.8771  0.1146 0; -0.2797  6.976e-3 -1.368e-2; 0.1946 -0.1257 -1.973e-4]
[-1.023 -1.444; 4.920 0.3648]
[0 0; -0.3295   0.304; -0.04073 -0.2737]
[-23.92; 5.921]
\end{verbatim}
    
    You can either include code in your submission or describe, with equations, how you calculated these angles without submitting code.

    \item Does the sign of the aileron input required to \emph{sustain} this turn match the sign of the aileron input required to \emph{initiate} the turn from steady level flight?
\end{enumerate}
