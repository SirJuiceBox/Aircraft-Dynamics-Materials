\begin{question}
    \noindent TRUE or FALSE: Consider an aircraft designed with typical stabilizing dihedral effect. If the wind that this aircraft is flying into suddenly changes so that the sideslip angle $\beta$ suddenly becomes positive, the immediate reaction of the aircraft in the roll direction will be a positive roll ($p > 0$) into the wind. Justify your answer.
