\begin{question}

For this problem \underline{assume the thrust is equal and opposite to the drag}. Consider an aircraft with the following parameters
\begin{table}[!h]

%\caption{Aircraft parameters}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
 m = 6.77 kg & c = 0.2 m   & b = 3.3 m \\
 S = 0.67 m$^2$ & $C_{D_{min}}$ = 0.02  &  K = 0.0224   \\
 $C_{L_{\alpha}}$ = 5.75 & $C_{L_{q}}$ = 10.14  & $C_{L_{\delta_e}}$ = 0.0079  \\
 $C_{m_{q}}$ = -24.4  & $C_{m_{\delta_e}}$ = -0.02  & $C_{m_{0}}$ = 0.12\\
 $C_{L_{min}} = 0$ & & 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the drag coefficient of the aircraft when at trim with density $\rho$ = 1.10 kg/m$^3$ and airspeed $V_a$ = 21 m/s?

\item Consider an aircraft flying with with density same airspeed and density above. You wish to put the aircraft in trim with $\delta_e = 1.65^{\circ}$ and $\alpha = 4.07^{\circ}$. These values balance the forces but not the moment. You are allowed to change the location $h$ of the center of gravity. If the neutral point $h_n$ = 0.75, where must you locate the center of gravity of the aircraft for it to be in trim?
