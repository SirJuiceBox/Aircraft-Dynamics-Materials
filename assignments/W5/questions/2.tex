\begin{question}
    The control matrix ${\bf B_{\delta_e}}$ from the elevator angle to the state derivative for the F-16 from Problem 3 is
    \begin{equation} \nonumber
    {\bf B_{\delta_e}} = 
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} 
    -.244 \\
    -1.46 \\
    -.20 \\
    0
    \end{array} \right]
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Calculate the natural frequency and damping ratio of the short period mode approximation. To create the short period approximation use the terms in the longitudinal matrix from Problem 3.
    \item Consider the control law $\Delta \delta_e = -k_1 \Delta q - k_2 \Delta \theta$ where $k_1 = -5.0$ and $k_2 = -0.005$. Using the short period mode approximation, calculate the new eigenvalues of the short period mode with this control law.
    \item What are the eigenvalues of the full closed loop state space model using the control law from Part 2? How do they compare to the approximation from Part 2?
    \end{enumerate}
