\begin{question}
    Suppose that the control forces and moments for a quadrotor with arm length $d = 10cm$ and rotor moment coefficient $k_m=0.003$ are given by
\begin{equation*}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c}
        Z_c \\ L_c \\ M_c \\ N_c
    \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
        -5 N \\ 0 Nm \\ 0.2 Nm \\ 0.01 Nm
    \end{array} \right] \text{.}
\end{equation*}
    If the quadrotor has the standard rotor configuration described in class, what are the thrust forces generated by each rotor?
\end{question}
